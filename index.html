		<h2>Hi, I'm Jane</h2>
		<p>I have a great job as a graphic designer for a small print shop called Record Printing. We're located in Thorp, Washington. Most of the work I do includes graphic and packaging design, research, copywriting, and marketing for our clients. My own time is spent working on passion projects of video production and web design. Current hobbies are flying a camera drone, watching movies, and making weird YouTube videos.</p>

						<h2>Firestone 3 Berry Mix</h2>
						<p>Firestone is a producer of fresh frozen fruit in the Pacific Northwest region. When they need packaging designs to show to potential buyers, they turn to me for design options.</p>

						<h2>Firestone Berry Mix Pitches</h2>
						<p>I like to give my clients the opportunity to choose from a few different design options. Sometimes the difference is only in the typeface, but that itself can change the tone of the overall design.</p>

						<h2>Healeo Organic Cold Pressed Juice</h2>
						<p>Healeo is a small juice company located in Seattle. When they approached me with ideas for a re-design of their old bottle labels, I worked with the company manager to create a clean, text-driven design with bright colors to complement the natural colors of the juices.</p>

						<h2>Firestone E-Mart Pouches</h2>
						<p>The design for these 300 gram sized pouches utilizes a scallloped border between the product image and the title. You can also look at it as being a sea of fruit.</p>

						<h2>Mixed Berry Crumbles</h2>
						<p>Frozen raspberries and blackberries will "crumble" during processing, and instead of wasting these small bits of fruit, they can be packaged and sold as a separate product. The package I designed and illustrated here is sold exclusively at Grocery Outlet stores. "Smoothies Anyone?" is an illustration I made that was inspired by this product.</p>

						<h2>Melting Strawberry</h2>
						<p>My personal artwork is heavily influenced by the fact that most of my work clients are food and beverage companies. This strawberry is melting. I don't have much else to say about it.</p>

						<h2>The Sweet Scoop</h2>
						<p>Inspired by low-poly artwork, and I had the idea to glue together a collage of magazine clippings to re-create the low-poly style. I scanned the collage into Photoshop and added some more graphical elements.</p>

						<h2>Patterns</h2>
						<p>Line art is my favorite style of illustration, and I love patterns. A pattern made of line art objects just makes sense to me.</p>

						<h2>Stephanie Corneliussen</h2>
						<p>Next to line art patterns, human portraits are my favorite thing to draw. My subject here is none other than actress/model/graphic designer Stephanie Corneliussen (you may know her from USA's Mr. Robot).</p>
